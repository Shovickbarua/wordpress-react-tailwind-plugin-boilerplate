# Wordpress React Tailwind CSS Plugin Boilerplate

Hi there :rocket: 

This boilerplate has built in support for react, react-router & tailwind CSS. I have used wordpress official script [@wordpress/scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/scripts) to implement react. I have included a complete crud operation using wordpress rest api & react to make it easier for beginners.

## Installation
+ First clone the the github repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Shovickbarua/wordpress-react-tailwind-plugin-boilerplate.git
```

+ Run npm installation command
```
npm install
```

+ Now run the project using this command
```
npm run start
```

## Upgrade to latest version

```
npm i @wordpress/scripts@latest
```

Happy Coding :wink:
